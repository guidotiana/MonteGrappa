#locked_atoms    N		# in a CA model, there's no need for it. it locks

imin            4		# minimum distance between backbone atoms

potential       go		# we use a go-type potential

go-energy       -1.5            # potential depth

				# that means: considering our protein to be made only 
				# of CA atoms, if the distance on the sequence 
				# between two of them is >=4 and if their distance 
				# in real space is between 4 and 6 Angstrom, then it 
				# sets a potential well with energy -1.5
