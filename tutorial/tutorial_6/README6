| TUTORIAL N. 6: adaptive simulated tempering + optimization simulation      |
\****************************************************************************/


In this short tutorial we will use MonteGrappa to find the interaction matrix
of 4 types of atoms in order to have the correct end to end contact probability.
The system is a segment (20 bases) of DNA

MonteGrappa needs three input files: 
- a .pol file, which contains the topology of the polymer
- a .pot file, which contains the details of the potential
- a .par file, which contains all the other parameters

You should see dna.pol, dna.pot, dna.par in this directory. Further in this directory
there is a file named dna.op containing the restrain for the optimization process.

More information about contents of these files, please refer to the manual.


Now run MonteGrappa (the single-core, stempering version!) 
	/path/where/is/montegrappa dna.pol dna.pot dna.par 


with all the arguments in this exact order. After 2 MC runs, you 
should have in your directory some files: 

Plot columns 1:2 of chi2.dat to see the X^2 minimization.
