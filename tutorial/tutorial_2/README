The file expdata.dat contains data of the kind obtained from a 5C/highC experiment. It is
in the format
bead1 bead2 average_count stdev_count

To generate the file.pol, file.pot and a typical file.par execute

./generate_5C.sh

answering to the questions it puts similarly to this:

Filename of the 5C/HiC data?
expdata.dat
Number of beads?
20
Normalization constant?
100
Rootname for output files?
test
Energy scale for initial interaction matrix (in temperature units)?
0.2
Interaction range (in units of interbeads distance)?
1.5
Hardcore radius  (in units of interbeads distance)?
0.6

It will generate four files, namely test.pol, test.pot, test.par and test.op
(and an additional file tmp.op with the list of bead pairs).
The file test.par contains typical parameters for the simulation, and can
be edited manually according to the needs. To launch the optimization just 
execute

nohup ../../bin/montegrappa test.pol test.pot test.par >& log &

You can follow the simulation inspecting the file log (e.g. tail -f log). After
each iteration a file restraints_%d.dat is generated, containing a comparison
between the input and the back-calculated data. They can be visualized, for
example with gnuplot, executing

gnuplot>  plot restraints_0.dat' u 2:3

The value of the back-calculated contact probability for each pair of beads
can be listed using

paste tmp.op restraints_0.dat | awk '{ print $1,$2,$7; }' > prob.dat
