| TUTORIAL N. 5: adaptive simulated tempering simulation                     |
\****************************************************************************/


In this short tutorial we will use MonteGrappa to study thermodynamics of a
small random energy polymer of 20 atoms.


MonteGrappa needs three input files: 

- a .pol file, which contains the topology of the polymer
- a .pot file, which contains the details of the potential
- a .par file, which contains all the other parameters

You should see random_polymer.pol, random_polymer.pot, random_polymer.par in
this directory

More information about contents of these files, please refer to the manual


Now run MonteGrappa (the single-core, stempering version!) 
	/path/where/is/montegrappa random_polymer.pol random_polymer.pot random_polymer.par 


with all the arguments in this exact order. After 1 billions MC steps, you 
should have in your directory some files: 

Plot columns 1:2 of files dumb.dat and thermdodyn.dat to see energy vs temperature
behaviour

Plot columns 1:4 of file thermdodyn.dat to see the Cv vs temperature
